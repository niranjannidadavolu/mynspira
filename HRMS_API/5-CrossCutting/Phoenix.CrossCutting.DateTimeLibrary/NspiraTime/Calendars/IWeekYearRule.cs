    /// Dates are usually identified within a calendar system by a calendar year, a month within that
    /// calendar year, and a day within that month. For example, the date of birth of Ada Lovelace can be identified
    /// within the Gregorian calendar system as the year 1815, the month December (12), and the day 10. However,
    /// dates can also be identified (again within a calendar system) by week-year, week and day-of-week. How
    /// that identification occurs depends on which rule you use - but again as an example, within the Gregorian
    /// calendar system, using the ISO-8601 week year rule, the date of Ada Lovelace's birth is week-year 1815,
    /// week 49, day-of-week Sunday.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// The calendar year of a date and the week-year of a date are the same in most rules for most dates, but aren't
    /// always. When they differ, it is usually because a day near the start of the calendar year is deemed to belong
    /// to the last week of the previous week-year - or conversely because a day near the end of the calendar year is
    /// deemed to belong to the first week of the following week-year. Some rules may be more radical -
    /// a UK tax year rule could number weeks from April 6th onwards, such that any date earlier than that in the calendar
    /// year would belong to the previous week-year.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// The mapping of dates into week-year, week and day-of-week is always relative to a specific calendar system.
    /// For example, years in the Hebrew calendar system vary very significantly in length due to leap months, and this
    /// is reflected in the number of weeks within the week-years - as low as 50, and as high as 55.
    /// </para>
