    /// This attribute only applies to types, not fields:
    /// it's entirely feasible to have a readonly field of a mutable type, or a read/write
    /// field of an immutable type. In such cases for reference types (classes and interfaces)
    /// it's important to distinguish between the value of the variable (a reference) and the
    /// object it refers to. Value types are more complicated as in some cases the compiler
    /// will copy values before operating on them; however as all value types in Noda Time are
    /// immutable (aside from explicitly implemented serialization operations) this rarely causes
    /// an issue.
    /// </p>
    /// <p>
    /// Some types may be publicly immutable, but contain privately mutable
    /// aspects, e.g. caches. If it proves to be useful to indicate the kind of
    /// immutability we're implementing, we can add an appropriate property to this
    /// attribute.
